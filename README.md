# AJAX Search

This project was made to help a fellow programmer in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55068182/get-request-with-different-mongo-find-results-on-same-page/55071932)

## Installation

Just a usual Node.js in installation

```bash
npm install
```

To see any results in your page, run

```bash
node insert.js
```

This will create a MongoDB database called `ajaxsearch` and will insert some documents in its `fruits` collection.

## Usage

To start the express server, run

```bash
node bin/www
```

and go to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to see the results.
